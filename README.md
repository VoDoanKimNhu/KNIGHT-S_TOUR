#KNIGHT'S_TOUR
<h1>ABOUT MY PROJECT</h1>
<p>I build a simple web page about Knight's Tour by HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
<p>Knight's Tour is a classical problem in graph theory. The object of this problem is to find a sequence of moves that allow the knight to visit every square on the board.</p>
<p>My solution is using Hamilton Algorithm to find the nearest way to trace</p>
<ul>
    <li>If it is found: output answer.</li>
    <li>If it is not found: rollback, recur and trace another way.</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried this and explored numerous interesting aspects.</p>
<p>For further improvements, I will update soon.</p>
<i>Thanks for viewing <3</i>
